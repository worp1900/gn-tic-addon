## HowTo - Use this addon

Simply download the Archive with Firefox. It will auto-install.

## HowTo - Develop this addon

The addon is written in Typescript. This means you will want a TS compiler and a source map.

I use VSCode and the setup is quite easy: [I'm an inline-style link with title](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-compiling).

You will have to compile the addon before you can first develop it.

## Future improvements / ideas

### Use Typescript instead of basic JS?
